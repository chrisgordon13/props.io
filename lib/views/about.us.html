		<h1>About Us</h1>

		<p class="lead">We are a small team of hospitality veterans looking to take the pain out of implementing and enforcing your organization's travel policy.</p>
		
		<p>We understand that your travel policy is created to provide guidelines for travelers which are aligned with your organization's growth and financial goals. We also understand that a traveler who is uncomfortable with their lodging situation is unproductive and potentially damaging to your organization's bottom line.</p>

		<p>Statistics vary widely, but it is far from uncommon for us to hear about travel policies that have compliance levels around 50%. That is, half of an organization's travel is done in violation of its travel policy.</p>

		<p>And in speaking with business travelers, we find that there is an overt willingness to book the most suitable accomodations at the best price even if the choice is out of compliance. Simply stated, travelers feel they do a better job at finding the best deals at the most appropriate hotels on their own.</p>

		<p>Methods to find these rates are what you would expect. Travelers routinely visit the websites of the large online travel agencies (Expedia, Orbitz, Travelocity, etc.) hunting for the best deals. This is where leisure travel is regularly shopped so it make sense that they would consider the same for business travel.</p>

		<p>We feel that giving your travelers the flexibility to shop the inventory of these sites while giving you the ability to set limits on pricing, quality, etc. offers a solution that benefits everybody involved. And, as you might imagine, that is what we offer.</p>

		<p>We have access to the indentical rates and availability of the large online travel agencies. However, we add the ability for you to set pricing and quality guidelines that can be enforced with configurable levels of strictness.</p>

		<p>We make money as affiliates of these agencies selling the exact same inventory at the exact same price as you find on there websites. In other words, you'll always get the best rates and you'll never need to cut us a check.</p>
		
		<p>Our offering is dead simple to set up and we're confident you can have a curated hotel list published in a matter of minutes. Yes, minutes. Not only that, but the listing will exist at a unique URL that can be passed around via email or embedded in your organization's intranet.</p>

		<h4>Who We Are</h4>

		<p>First and foremost, we're individuals that have been in your traveler's shoes. We've experienced the pain of using clunky booking tools that offer limited choice and flexibility in the name of compliance. We've stayed at properties that were inconveniently located offering substandard amenities at pathetic 'preferred' pricing.</p>

		<p>As hospitality industry veterans, specifically in the corporate travel market, we've spoken with hundreds of travel managers and travel agents. We've heard about their difficulties in sourcing adequate lodging for their traveler's at competitive prices. There's a reason Expedia, Orbitz and Travelocity have great rates, they're fantastic negotiators with massive volume.</p>

		<p>We have deployed products that have collected and managed mountains of data related to prefered travel programs, travel policies and compliance. We think we have some good ideas about what makes an effective travel policy implemented in a sane way.</p>
		
		<p>Finally, we know we don't have all the answers and want to hear about what works and what doesn't. We're committed to getting your travelers comfortable with your travel policy in a way that keeps them productive on the road.</p>
