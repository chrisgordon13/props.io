			<p class="lead">We're developing a service which:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Allows you to quickly and easily publish custom hotel booking sites which support your travel policies.</li>

				<li>Ensures both you and your travelers are able to meet your travel objectives.</li>
				<li>Provides this all for free.</li>
			</ol>

			<h4>Who You Are</h4>
			<p>You're in charge of travel or travel compliance at your company. You may be a travel manager, in human resources, finance or accounting. You understand the value of a travel policy and the difficulties with travel policy compliance. You may be evaluating or using existing tools for this job or are just getting started in implementing a travel program.</p>
					
			<h4>Who We Are</h4>
			<p>We're a small team with specific experience developing products for the corporate travel market. We've spoken to hundreds of travel managers, travel agents and travel management companies. We've documented their challenges and feel there is an unaddressed need. Finally, we're individuals who have been in your traveler's shoes. We've experience the pain of corporate booking tools mandated by our employers in the name of compliance.</p>
					
			<h4>We Want You</h4>
			<p>We'd love 15 minutes of your time to learn about your needs and objectives, show you our vision, and discuss how we think we can help.</p>
